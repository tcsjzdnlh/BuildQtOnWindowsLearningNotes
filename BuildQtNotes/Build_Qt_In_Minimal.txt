It went down to 5.3 MB. 5.3 MB was still too bit, 
so I went through the features from qfeatures.txt, 
and did "-no-feature" for every single feature listed.  
libQt5Core wouldn't compile without LIBRARY, 
SETTINGS and REGULAREXPRESSION, 
so I took the "-no-feature" out for those things.  
Even with all of that removed, 
libQt5Core.so.5.3.0 was still 4.3 MB after being stripped.  
That would have some things removed though that we want.

Is there any way to get Qt Core to compile smaller, 
like under 3MB? 
Am I missing anything to skip 
or "-no-xyz" or "-nomake" or "-no-feature"?  
Why is libQt5Core.so.5.3.0 so much bigger than libQtCore4.so.4.8.4?

We may just need to move to 4.8.6 
and leave it there instead of jumping onto 5.x.

Thanks,
-Daniel
